# Alerts

Alerts provide feedback to users for important actions.

## Variants

- **Success**: Positive feedback.
- **Error**: Negative feedback.
- **Warning**: Cautionary feedback.

## Code Example

```jsx
<div class="alert alert-success">Success! Your action was completed.</div>
<div class="alert alert-error">Error! Something went wrong.</div>
<div class="alert alert-warning">Warning! Proceed with caution.</div>
```

## Accessibility

- Use `role="alert"` for dynamic alerts.
- Maintain color contrast for visibility.
